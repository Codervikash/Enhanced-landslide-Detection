## 🧠 Overview

This project provides a complete implementation of a **Hybrid Deep Learning Model** combining **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** and **Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM)** for the **detection of landslide-prone areas** from remote sensing imagery. The approach is inspired by the research article:

## 🖼️ Dataset Description

- **Sources**: Google Earth and ISRO’s Bhuvan platform
- **Categories**:
  - Landslide Images
  - Non-Landslide Images
- **Image Size**: All images are resized to `128x128x3` (RGB)
- **Augmentation Techniques**:
  - Rotations: 90°, 180°, 270°
  - Horizontal & Vertical Flipping
  - Brightness Adjustments

> 🧪 Augmentation helps increase generalization and model robustness.

## 🧱 Model Architecture

### 🔹 CNN Block (Spatial Feature Extraction)

| Layer        | Parameters             |
|--------------|------------------------|
| Conv2D       | 3×3 filters, 32/64/128 |
| Activation   | ReLU                   |
| MaxPooling   | 2×2                    |
| Dropout      | 0.25                   |

### 🔹 BiLSTM Block (Contextual/Sequential Modeling)

- BiLSTM with 128 hidden units
- Dropout: 0.5
- Learns both forward and backward dependencies of spatial features

### 🔹 Dense Layers (Classification)

- Dense (64), Activation: ReLU
- Dropout (0.5)
- Dense (1), Activation: Sigmoid

> Final output is a binary class: `1` = Landslide, `0` = Non-Landslide

## 🔢 Technical Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Resize images to 128×128
   - Normalize pixel values to [0, 1]
   - Augment training dataset to prevent overfitting

2. **Model Training**:
   - Optimizer: Adam
   - Loss: Binary Cross-Entropy
   - Batch Size: 32
   - Epochs: 50

3. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - Accuracy
   - Precision
   - Recall
   - F1-Score

4. **Result Visualization**:
   - Confusion Matrix
   - ROC Curve
   - Loss vs Accuracy plots

---

## 📈 Results

| Metric     | Value     |
|------------|-----------|
| Accuracy   | **96.6%** |
| Precision  | 94.6%     |
| Recall     | 96.8%     |
| F1-Score   | 95.6%     |

> ✅ Outperforms standalone CNN and LSTM models in both precision and recall.
